                Activity can operate only after its charter is submitted to and
                approved by the Clubs & Pubs administrators. Charters are
                reviewed on a fixed day each week and may be approved only
                between August 1 and May 31. Once a charter is approved, it
                becomes visible on the Epsilon site and the Activity leaders
                receive email confirmation. <br />

                Every Activity must have at least two leaders—either two

                least once per month, in person or online, with each meeting
                registered on Epsilon. Activities inactive for more than one
                month risk suspension or revocation of their charter. The SU may
                merge Activities with substantially similar missions, may
                suspend any Activity that violates its charter, and requires
                that all charter changes receive prior approval from the Clubs &

                All meetings are subject to audit by an SU Auditor, who reports
                to the directors of the SU Clubs & Pubs department. Any
                violation of meeting rules results in a strike unless otherwise
                noted; three strikes—regardless of type—revoke the charter and
                cannot be appealed. <br />
                <br />
                Meetings must remain orderly and respectful. Complaints by staff
                or SU Auditors concerning inappropriate behavior—such as
                fighting, roughhousing, discriminatory remarks, or any breach of
                the Code of Conduct or Chancellor’s Regulations—may lead to
                immediate suspension.
                <br />
                <br />
                For events or meetings off school premises, the registered
                faculty advisor must contact clubpub@stuysu.org, COSA Mr.
                Polazzo (MPolazz@schools.nyc.gov, Room 260), and Assistant
                Principal Mr. Moran (BMoran@schools.nyc.gov, Room 103) at least
                one week in advance with full event details and must attend the
                entire event alongside the faculty advisor for the Activity. The
                correspondence should detail the date, location, paperwork,
                number of people attending, Activity leader(s) and faculty
                advisor names for the event.
                <br />
                <br />
                Activities must vacate the building by 5:00 PM unless
                accompanied by a registered faculty advisor. SMARTBoards may not
                be used during meetings, and media carts may be borrowed only
                when a faculty advisor signs them in and out. Flyers or
                advertisements may not be posted until a charter is approved;
                all flyers must be removed within a week after the event, and
                any flyer deemed inappropriate—or placed near escalators—will be
                removed without notice.

                Room Reservations and Usage
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph marginBottom={5}>
                All Activities must reserve a room to be able to hold a meeting.
                Rooms must be reserved on Epsilon StuyActivities, which operates
                on a first-come, first-served basis, and no Activity is
                guaranteed a particular room.
                <br />
                <br />
                Long-term reservations require an email request to
                clubpub@stuysu.org explaining the need. Rooms must be restored
                to their original condition after each meeting; staff or Auditor
                complaints about cleanliness or damage may result in strikes or
                suspension. Activities must use the specific room indicated on
                Epsilon, cancel reservations at least 24 hours in advance if
                plans change, and email clubpub@stuysu.org or consult an SU
                representative if no suitable room is available. Reserving
                non-classroom facilities—such as the cafeteria, auditorium, or
                lecture halls—requires the faculty advisor to email
                clubpub@stuysu.org, Mr. Polazzo, and Mr. Moran at least one week
                ahead with full justification and logistics. Guest speakers may
                enter the building only after all listed parties approve the
                request and School Safety Agents are notified.

                Funding
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph marginBottom={5}>
                The SU manages all Activity funding. Requests will be denied if
                they involve unapproved trips, unapproved supplies or services
                (including guest speakers), personal items that members keep,
                faculty-advisor compensation, computer systems or software, food
                or beverages, or apparel. Two funding rounds occur each year—one
                in Fall and one in Spring. Prior to each round, Activities
                receive a budget application and rules. Only Activities needing
                funds should apply, and compliant applicants are scheduled for a
                meeting with the SU Budget Committee. At least one Activity
                leader and the faculty advisor must attend; failure to do so
                results in automatic denial, while legitimate conflicts must be
                emailed in advance to clubpub@stuysu.org and budget@stuysu.org.
                <br />
                <br />
                When requesting support, an Activity may seek either a grant or
                a loan. A grant requires the Activity to pay upfront, retain
                original receipts, and submit them to budget@stuysu.org for
                reimbursement (excluding tax). Reimbursement checks are
                available from Ms. Caruzo in Room 103 roughly two weeks after
                submission, and the tax-exempt form supplied by the Budget
                Department should be used to avoid sales tax. A loan must be
                repaid by the end of the school year unless otherwise specified.
                Acceptance of SU funds obligates Activities to cooperate fully
                with audits, submit receipts within seven days of each purchase,
                present purchased items on request, and return all items to SU
                storage at year-end; items are reissued the next year if the
                Activity still exists, otherwise the SU retains them. First
                violations trigger a warning unless severe; a second infraction
                allows the Budget Department to withdraw funding and suspend the
                Activity. Any misuse of funds results in immediate suspension
                and charter revocation. Funding rules may be amended by majority
                vote of the Budget Committee.
                <br />
                <br />A faculty advisor must be present for speakers or lectures
                in large venues, for any off‑site event with members present,
                for meetings in the building after 5:00 PM, and whenever SU
                funding is requested. The advisor must also sign the
                “Advisor/COSA” field on reimbursement forms for purchases made
                with Clubs & Pubs allocations. Activities that have accumulated
                three strikes may reapply for a charter after suspension; if
                reinstated, a faculty advisor must attend all meetings until the
                SU states otherwise.

                Procedures; certain items may be purchased with General School
                Funds only after written approval from the Business Manager,
                APO, and Principal. Personal funds should not be used without
                prior written approval, as reimbursements are otherwise
                prohibited and tax is never reimbursed. Expenditure requests
                must be filed on the official “Request for Expenditure” form,
                accompanied by invoices (not quotes or statements) within two
                weeks of delivery or payment. Requests associated with events,
                trips, or merchandise require supporting documents such as
                agendas, attendance sheets, trip approval forms, or signed

                Deposits are accepted only by Dina Ingram in Room 105 or 273C on
                Tuesdays and Thursdays. Cash and checks must be separated by
                denomination; checks must be payable to Stuyvesant High School
                and include the student’s name and OSIS on the memo line. The
                “Authorization to Collect General School Funds” form must be
                completed before collecting any money, and only faculty advisors
                or designated staff may oversee the process—students may never
                handle funds directly. All fundraising requires prior written
                approval on this form, and every event must complete a “Final
                Statement at Conclusion of Revenue Producing Activity” reporting
                all sales and profits or losses. Funds must be deposited
                immediately after the event or within three days and never
                stored off campus or with students. Only cash and checks may be
                deposited, although the school website may be used for large
                electronic payments. All forms for financial transactions are
